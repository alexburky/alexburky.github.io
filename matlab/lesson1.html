      <h1>Lesson 1: How to Install irisFetch.m</h1>
      <hr>

      <p>
        The goal of this exercise is to equip ourselves with a fundamental skill
        necessary for global seismology research - <i>getting data to look at</i>.
        I'm going to assume that you already have MATLAB up and running on your
        computer at this point, but before we can move forward we're going to need
        to install a few files. Researchers from the
        <a class="text-link" href="https://www.iris.edu/hq/" target="_blank">Incorporated Research
          Institutions for Seismology (IRIS)</a>
        have created a MATLAB function which allows us to quickly and easily
        download seismic data - <b>directly to our computers!</b>
        Pay a visit to their
        <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/iris-edu/irisFetch-matlab/releases" target="_blank">GitHub
          link</a>,
          and download the <code class="matlab">.zip</code> file for the latest release.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once your download is completed, go ahead and unzip the file. Inside you'll
        find a typical MATLAB <code class="matlab">.m</code> file, as well as a <code class="matlab">README</code>. I recommend you get
        into the habit of reading <code class="matlab">README</code> files now, but since this is a tutorial
        I'll break down the next steps for you here.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get <code class="matlab">irisFetch.m</code> to work properly, you have to have the IRIS-WS java
        library installed. Head to
        <a class="text-link" href="http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/IRIS-WS/" target="_blank">this
        page</a> and find and download the latest release - at the time of
        writing this is <code class="matlab">IRIS-WS-2.0.19.jar</code>. Once you've successfully downloaded this file,
        follow along with the instructions below corresponding to the operating
        system you are using.
      </p>

      <h2>macOS Users</h2>

      <p>
        To effectively use the <code class="matlab">irisFetch.m</code> script, we would like to be able to
        call it whenever we are writing code in MATLAB. In order to make this
        function accessible to us from anywhere within MATLAB, we need to add a
        few lines to our <b><code class="matlab">startup.m</code></b> file. This is a file which MATLAB
        automatically runs when it launches, so you can use it to load in
        specific functions which you would like to be able to access while using
        MATLAB.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, <code class="matlab">startup.m</code> does not exist by
        default, so we are going to have to make it ourselves. With MATLAB opened,
        go ahead and open up a new script (&#8984N) and add the following lines:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre><code class="matlab">% startup.m
%
% Last modified MM/DD/YYYY by yourname@email.com</pre></code>
      </div>

    <p>
      but replace the date and email with appropriate values. Next, we need
      to figure out where to save this file. In the
      Command Window, type <code class="matlab">userpath</code> to retrieve the
      directory which MATLAB searches upon starting up. On my machine, this
      returns:
    </p>

      <div>
        <pre><code class="Makefile">>> userpath

ans =

'/Users/MYUSERNAME/Documents/MATLAB'</pre></code>
      </div>

    <p>
      This is the folder that you need to save your
      <code class="matlab">startup.m</code> file in so that MATLAB can find it
      when it launches. If you are unfamiliar with folders, paths, and
      navigating your filesystem with Terminal, I recommend you go through my
      <a class="text-link" href="lesson0.html" target="_blank">Terminal tutorial</a> before continuing.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you've successfully saved your <code class="matlab">startup.m</code>
      file, go ahead and open up Terminal, and navigate to your base directory
      with the <code class="Makefile">cd</code> command. We are going to create
      a few folders in our base directory to get our filesystem organized for
      our future convenience.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have adopted the convention of naming folders using a system which
      helps me to easily remember what is saved where. I store all of my
      MATLAB functions as <code class="matlab">.m</code> files in a folder named
      <code class="Makefile">MFILES</code>. Similarly, I like to keep Java <code class="Makefile">.jar</code> files,
      like the one we just downloaded, in a folder named <code class="Makefile">JFILES</code>.
      I keep both of these folders in my base directory, so I can easily remember their
      paths. This leads to a directory structure looking something like...
    </p>

    <div class="clt">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users/
          <ul>
            <li>
              $USERNAME/
              <ul>
                <li>JFILES/</li>
                <li>MFILES/</li>
                <li>Applications/</li>
                <li>...</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </li>
    </div>

    <p>
      To create this structure for yourself, go ahead and execute <code class="matlab">mkdir JFILES</code>
      followed by <code class="matlab">mkdir MFILES</code> while in your base directory in Terminal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, we need to move the IRIS-WS <code class="matlab">.jar</code> file to the
      <code class="matlab">JFILES</code> directory. Presumably, this file will still be in your
      <code class="matlab">Downloads</code> folder, so we can move it to the <code class="matlab">JFILES</code> directory
      by executing the following in Terminal:
    </p>

      <div>
       <pre><code class="Makefile">mv ~/Downloads/IRIS-WS-2.0.19.jar ~/JFILES/</code></pre>
      </div>

    <p>
      While we're here, we should also move the <code class="matlab">irisFetch.m</code> function to
      the <code class="matlab">MFILES</code> directory so we can easily access it for future use. We can do
      this by executing the following in Terminal:
    </p>

    <div>
     <pre><code class="Makefile">mv ~/Downloads/irisFetch-matlab-2.0.11/irisFetch.m ~/MFILES/</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      Great! We're almost there! All we have left to do before we can download some seismic data is to
      tell MATLAB to look for both of these files when it launches. Go back into MATLAB, open up
      your <code class="matlab">startup.m</code> file and add the following lines:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre><code class="matlab">% Path to MFILES
addpath /Users/$USERNAME/MFILES

% Path to IRIS-WS .jar file
javaaddpath('/Users/$USERNAME/JFILES/IRIS-WS-2.0.19.jar');
      </pre></code>
    </div>

    <p>
      making sure you replace <code class="matlab">$USERNAME</code> with the
      appropriate value for your machine. Now go ahead and restart MATLAB. When it re-opens,
      execute <code class="matlab">irisFetch</code> in the Command Window. If you've set
      everything up successfully, you should see something like the following:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre><code class="Makefile">>> irisFetch

ans =

<b><u>irisFetch</u></b> with properties:

            VERSION: '2.0.11'
     DATE_FORMATTER: 'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS.FFF'
    MIN_JAR_VERSION: '2.0.15'
    VALID_QUALITIES: {'D' 'R' 'Q' 'M' 'B'}
    DEFAULT_QUALITY: 'M'
       FETCHER_LIST: {'Traces' 'Stations' 'Events' 'Resp'}
  forceDataAsDouble: 1
   </pre></code>
    </div>

    <p>
      Congratulations! The hardest part is over and now we can finally get on to
      the interesting part - downloading seismic data!
