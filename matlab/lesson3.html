      <h1>Lesson 3: What is the Instrument Response?</h1>
      <hr>

      <p>
        Before we get ahead of ourselves and start downloading and analyzing
        massive amounts of seismic data, we should take a step back and discuss
        some of the technical details of the data.
      </p>

      <h2>Transfer Functions</h2>

      <p>
        In modern seismology, the data we analyze typically come from digital
        seismometers. These instruments do not directly record the physical
        quantities we are interested in: displacement, velocity, or acceleration, but
        instead record a digital representation of them known as 'counts.' This
        process is performed by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the details
        of which are beyond the scope of this post. For our sake as seismologists,
        we are predominantly interested in undoing the effects of this process to
        arrive back at the physical quantities we are interested in measuring. In order to do
        this, we can use some basic results from the theory of linear time-invariant systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        A linear time-invariant system takes an input signal \( x(t) \) and produces an
        output signal \( y(t) \) according to the following convolution integral,

        $$ y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(t - \tau) h(\tau) d\tau $$

        where \( h(\tau) \) is the impulse response of the system. Conveniently for us,
        a digital seismometer is well represented as a linear time-invariant system.
        In practice, we observe the output of our seismometer \( y(t) \) but are
        interested in the input signal \( x(t) \). In order to get the original input
        by solving the above integral equation, we need to additionally know the
        impulse response \( h(\tau) \). This function can be determined by measuring the
        response of the instrument to well-known inputs like delta functions, \( \delta(t) \).
        These impulse response functions are routinely determined when a seismometer is calibrated,
        and can easily be acquired using <code class="matlab">irisFetch.m</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, even if we have the impulse response function, the integral equation above
        doesn't look particularly easy to solve in its current form. Luckily for us,
        there is a neat mathematical trick we can use to simplify it. It turns out that
        the convolution of two functions in the time domain is equal to the multiplication
        of those functions in the frequency domain:

        $$ y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(t - \tau) h(\tau) d\tau = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{X(s)H(s)\} $$

        where \( X(s) = \mathcal{F}\{x(t)\} \), \( H(s) = \mathcal{F}\{h(t)\} \),
        \( \mathcal{F} \) and \( \mathcal{F}^{-1} \) represent the Fourier and inverse
        Fourier transforms, and \( s = \sigma + i \omega \) is a complex number. In the
        transformed space, \( H(s) \) is typically referred to as the transfer function -
        probably because it has the property of transferring inputs to outputs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rearranging this equation, we find that we can solve for \( x(t) \) with the following:

        $$ x(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{\frac{Y(s)}{H(s)}\right\} $$

        where \( Y(s) = \mathcal{F}\{y(t)\} \). So it turns out that all we need to do to get the
        original input is Fourier transform our observed data, divide by the transfer function \( H(s) \),
        and inverse Fourier transform the result.
      </p>

      <h2>Poles and Zeros</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to providing access to seismic time-series data,
        <a class="text-link" href="https://www.iris.edu/hq/" target="_blank">IRIS</a>
         provides access to instrument response information for its seismometers. This
         information is typically stored in a RESP file or a SAC_PZs file, but the critical
         information we need to correct for the instrument response are the poles,
         zeros, and a constant which specifies the gain of the system. This is because the
         transfer function \( H(s) \) can be represented as a complex valued polynomial

         $$ H(s) = k \frac{(s - z_{1})(s - z_{2})...(s - z_{m})}{(s - p_{1})(s - p_{2})...(s - p_{n})} $$

         with \( m \) zeros, \( n \) poles, and a gain of \( k \). So if we know the poles,
         zeros, and gain, we can construct the transfer function. In the next post
         we will take a look at some code which does this as part of the overall
         instrument response correction process.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before we wrap this up, it is worth exploring a few useful features of
        the transfer function that should be a part of routine analysis for
        a seismologist. The transfer function can be a bit difficult to visualize
        due to it being complex valued, but two of its properties can be extracted
        and visualized to help us better understand what it is doing: the amplitude
        and phase response.
      </p>

      <p>
        The amplitude response of a complex valued function can be calculated
        by taking the abosulte value of the function, \( |H(s)| \). Remember that
        the absolute value of a complex number is given by:

        $$ |\sigma + i \omega| = \sqrt{\sigma^{2} + \omega^{2}} $$

        The phase response of a complex valued function is calculated by finding the
        argument of the function, \( \text{Arg}(H(s)) \). Geometrically, the argument
        is the angle between the real axis and the line connecting the point
        \( \sigma + i \omega \) to the origin. It can be calculated using the two
        argument arctangent function:

        $$ \text{Arg}(\sigma + i \omega) = \text{atan}2(\sigma, \omega) $$

        The amplitude and phase response for the vertical component (BHZ) of a Nanometrics Trillium 240 Sec
        Response sn 0-399/Qua seismometer, which was deployed in Allentown, New
        Jersey as part of the US Array experiment, are shown below:
      </p>

      <div style="100%">
        <img src="../img/amp_response.png" width="575px" height="auto"/>
        <img src="../img/phase_response.png" width="575px" height="auto"/>
      </div>

      <p>
        Notice that the amplitude response has units of (Counts / m/s). This particular
        transfer function can be used to convert to and from velocity. The amplitude
        response is flat from about 0.01 Hz to 10 Hz for this particular instrument,
        and there is little phase distortion in this frequency range, except for small
        deviations from 0 at the ends. Another feature which is shown on these plots
        is the Nyquist frequency of the instrument, which is indicated by the black
        dashed line at 20 Hz.
      </p>

      <p>
        From these plots, we have learned that for this particular instrument,
        input signals with frequencies between 0.01 and 10 Hz should be reliably
        resolved. Input signals outside of this frequency band will not be resolved
        as reliably. This is very important to keep in mind down the road when we
        start analyzing seismic data recorded in different frequency bands.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next post, we'll take a look at how we can make plots like these
        on our own using data downloaded with <code class="matlab">irisFetch.m</code>,
        as well as how to perform the deconvolution required to recover the original
        input signal. As a useful resource, <a class="text-link" href="https://www.iris.edu/hq/" target="_blank">IRIS</a>
        provides amplitude and phase response plots for all of the seismometers
        in their database as part of their <a class="text-link" href="https://ds.iris.edu/mda/" target="_blank">MetaData Aggregator</a>.
        Simply select a network code, then station code, and finally a channel code to
        find the plots.
