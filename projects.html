        <h1>Traverse</h1><hr>
        <p>Language: C++/SFML</p>
        <p>Platforms: Windows/MacOS</p>

        <p>Traverse is a 2D platformer RPG written entirely in C++ using
          <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/" target="_blank">SFML</a>. I developed the physics engine
          entirely from scratch as a way to learn the fundamentals of game engine development. Each level
          is specified as a tilemap, with options for flat, sloped, and moving terrain. The combat engine
          supports melee and ranged combat, and there are a wide variety of weapon types available in game.
          In addition to a complete physics engine, Traverse also has typical RPG UI systems like an inventory
          with tabs based on item type, an equipment window where the player can change their gear, and a
          settings menu to adjust key-bindings. The world of Traverse is also inhabited by friendly NPCs
          which the player can receive quests from, trade with, and chat with. Quests are stored in the player's
          quest log, and offer valuable rewards like experience, gold, and rare items. Upon leveling up, the player
          is rewarded with skill points which can be used to unlock new abilities and power-ups. These
          points are in addition to ability points, which the player can use to increase their base stats.
        </p>

        <p>Demo versions of the game and source code are available upon request.</p>

        <p>Release date: TBD</p>
